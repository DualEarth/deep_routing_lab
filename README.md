# Deep Terrain Routing Lab

## Overview

The Deep Terrain Routing Lab is aimed at developing ML tools for studying and predicting surface water flow across terrain. 

## Project Components

### 1. Synthetic Dataset Generation

This component focuses on creating synthetic datasets for training and validating our terrain routing models:

- **Synthetic Digital Elevation Models (DEM)**: Generate DEMs that represent realistic topographical features.
- **Synthetic Precipitation Layers**: Simulate precipitation events driving surface water response.

### 2. Terrain Routing Simulation

Simulate water flow across the synthetic DEMs to represent hydrologic response under varying atmospheric and terrain conditions.

### 3. Deep Learning Model for Terrain Routing

Develop a neural network model to predict the distribution of water across the terrain rainfall.
